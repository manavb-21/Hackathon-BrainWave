**SkillGap Finder**

SkillGap Finder is an AI-powered platform that helps students and early professionals understand *why* they are getting rejected and *what exactly* they need to improve for a specific role.

Instead of giving generic resume scores, the system allows users to upload their **resume** and a **target job description**. Using AI-driven semantic analysis, it compares both to:

* Extract relevant skills
* Identify missing and mismatched skills
* Understand real role expectations

Based on this, SkillGap Finder generates a **role-specific, prioritized learning roadmap** that tells users:

* What to learn
* In what order
* Why it matters

The experience is designed to be **gamified**, turning career growth into an interactive journey with milestones, progress tracking, and clear goals. The platform works across both **technical and non-technical roles**, making it useful for internships, entry-level jobs, and career transitions.

Our focus is **actionable guidance, not prediction**.
SkillGap Finder doesn’t tell users whether they’ll get a job — it shows them exactly how to become *job-ready*.
